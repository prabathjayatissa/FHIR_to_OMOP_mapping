# FHIR_to_OMOP_mapping

The methodology for implementing OMOP -on-FHIR involves leveraging the FHIRstandard as a meta-model to integrate common data models, 
utilizing the Java HAPIFHIR-API for server architecture, and validating the solution th rough patient dataexchange with a FHIR reference implementation server. 
Collaboration between HL7 andthe OHDSI community also aims to create a single common data model that integratesHL7 FHIR and OMOP.
Moreover, using FHIR as an intermediate representation Created a comprehensive FHIR to OMOP CDM mapping system with the following features:

Type Definitions:

FHIR resource interfaces
OMOP CDM table interfaces

Mappers:

PatientMapper: FHIR Patient → OMOP Person
ConditionMapper: FHIR Condition → OMOP Condition_Occurrence
Mapping Service:

Handles individual resources and FHIR bundles
Extensible for additional resource types
Tests:

Unit tests for both mappers
Validates mapping logic
The system is modular and can be extended to support additional FHIR resources and OMOP tables. Would you like me to add support for any specific FHIR resources or explain any part in detail?
